castbridge is a simple tool to allow Chromecast discovery to work across
different subnets. At the moment, simply proxying the SSDP discovery
requests and responses seems to be sufficient, so that's all this tool
does.

The casting machine(s) must be able to directly communicate with the
Chromecast device. For example, on a Tomato-based router, add these two
new rules in Advanced > LAN Access:
- One rule that permits machines to talk to the forwarding service on
  the Chromecast subnet.
- Another rule that allows machines to talk to the Chromecast itself.

Usage:
On the Chromecast subnet, start the forwarding service:
$ castbridge

On the other subnet, start the SSDP listening service:
$ castbridge --endpoint <IP of forwarding service>
